# orm_burger

This burger web application seeks to create an MVC structured database that updates from the client-side `/public/` to our server-side controllers and ORM. And then passing the information back for viewing by the user. Avoiding callback hell was challenging, especially when choosing pure JS rather than jQuery or another framework/library.
